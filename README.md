# NbaCoachSim2

The created application is a managerial game created for two players: 1v1, in the realities of the NBA,
more specifically in the clubs of the Atlantic division. We have 5 teams at our disposal:
• Brooklyn Nets
• Boston Celtics
• New York Knicks
• Philadelphia 76ers
• Toronto Raptors
The application has a simplified mechanism for managing the team and its composition during the match.The app goal
is to provide users with the opportunity to have fun and provide a pinch of experience and
emotions that accompany real NBA matches on the coaching bench. The app is a graphic version of another program
available at the link: https://github.com/danrok19/KckNbaGm1.0.git
